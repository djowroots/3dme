* Time on screen : ```client.lua``` line 2 : ```local time = 500```

## Update

* Added "the person" at the beginning of the text (```Line 7``` if you want to change the language)
* Using /me multiple times doesn't make it unreadable

## Note
* This couldn't work if you use a custom chat resource.
* This could conflict with other /me scripts (just disable them).
